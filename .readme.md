# Chord Slots

A simple tool for producing music composition challenges. The goal is to create a musical thought using the generated chords in the order they are provided. The challenge is adjusted by various factors like strictly using the chords provided, allowing transition chords between them, substituting the minor version of the chord, using sixth, seventh, and ninth variations, etc.

## Roadmap

1. Produce 4 random, non-repeating chords on demand
2. Mobile view responsive \*
3. Progressive Web App status, installable on mobile
4. Styling pleasing to the eye
5. Provide options to change the available chords (minor, diminished, maj7 min7, 7th, 9th, etc.)
6. Curate difficulties by creating specific views for different groupings of chord options
7. Support recording a musical idea within the app and option to download recording as mp3.
